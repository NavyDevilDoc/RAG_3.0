	"What is the definition of life-cycle cost?": "Life-cycle cost (LCC) can be defined as the total cost to the government of a program over its full life (cradle-to-grave)",
    "Compare and contrast the analogy and parametric methods of cost estimation.": "The analogy method is a very early initial estimate and one-to-one comparison with existing or similar systems and subsystems. It is inexpensive and experience-based but is only a high level estimate and highly subjective. The parametric method, on the other hand, looks at cost estimating relationships between performance parameters. It requires a high-quality database while it works well with many quantitative measurements and is inexpensive, it's moderately subjective and relies on the quality of the database.",
    "Compare and contrast total ownership cost and life-cycle cost.": "Total ownership cost (TOC) includes life-cycle costs, commmon spares and support systems, the cost for planning, maintaining, operating, and executing infrastructure projects, and indirect costs not covered by life-cycle costs. Life-cycle cost (LCC) is a subset of TOC and includes R&D, investment, O&S, disposal, direct acquisition costs, direct program costs, obvious indirect costs, and traditionally excludes most infrastructure costs.",
    "What is learning curve theory?": "Learning curve theory states that as the quantity of units produced doubles, the time required to produce each unit decreases by a fixed percentage. This is based on the idea that the more units produced, the more efficient the process becomes, leading to reduced costs per unit."
